<p>This is GameStash, an application for keeping track of your game collection!</p>
<p>You can create and delete consoles, and create, edit, and delete games from the collection.</p>
<p>The dashboard will keep track of how many games you have in your collection, and you can also document what condition your game is in.</p> 
<br/>
<p>This is my first Full Stack PERN application. This is the client side of the application which uses React as it's front end. I am using 
React Hooks to manage state and components. I am also using Axios for my server connection. There is full smoke testing implemented for all components and routes as well.</p>
<br/>
<p>This was a project for my Thinkful program. We have requirements for the application so between that I was not able to do everything I wanted. In the next version 
I am planning on adding user authentication and using a 3rd party API for fetching data for games.</p>
